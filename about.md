I'm a software engineer, CTO and co-founder of RAW Labs. My work focuses on large-scale data management for complex business and scientific datasets.

At RAW I'm helping build the next-generation query engine for modern-day datasets. Prior to founding RAW Labs, I was a database researcher at EPFL working on scientific data management. Before that, I was staff member at CERN, responsible for building the distributed data management system of the ATLAS Experiment of the Large Hadron Collider.
